The file test.js is set up to run the same code that the background script uses to evaluate Javascript.

To use, copy the appropriate functions from main_background.js ("full_evaluate" and anything that it references). Then, build the script with browserify by running:

browserify test.js -o test_bundle.js

and load the file "index.js" with a web browser.
